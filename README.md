# My Homebrew tap

Just a Homebrew tap to use for things I want to install via Homebrew but which don't have formulas.

# How to install

You can install any formula here by typing:

```sh
brew install zalt50/zalt/<formula>
```

Or you can manually tap this repository first:

```sh
brew tap zalt50/zalt
brew install <formula>
```
